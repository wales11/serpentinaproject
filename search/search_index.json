A lot of things are going well for the Serpentina Arts project. My partner, Jun, and I work well together and we complement each other. We conducted our interview on the first day it was available and received a lot of information from Andres. Andres replies really fast, faster than I was expecting if I\u2019m being honest. It\u2019s really nice, he is quite flexible with his schedule and he is very passionate about his work and he wants to expand for the future, and this artist bio will be one of the things that helps him reach his goals. He also has a definitive plan for his next major project, and this bio we complete will be a big part of that journey. I\u2019m really excited and glad that Jun and I are able to help him, even if it's in a small way. I want to say that the work time we\u2019ve been given in class has been very helpful to me in completing this project, and I\u2019ve completed a majority of this project in class. Almost no professors actually give me time to work during class, so this has been a refreshing change for me. Lastly, the interview went way better than I was expecting. I\u2019m not sure why I thought this would be very formal, or kind of strict, but I was pleasantly surprised when Andres was very nice, flexible, and funny. It made the project seem personal, and that it is something he truly wants, which was a worry of mine going in that my client wouldn\u2019t want to do the bio, didn\u2019t need it, or wouldn\u2019t respond. What has been challenging? The biggest challenge so far has been motivation for me. It\u2019s hard to set aside time for me to do things when there is such a large time frame between due dates or parts of the project. While I have completed everything before I expected, and before it was due, I still find myself thinking that I could\u2019ve done some things sooner. It\u2019s also a bit weird when we talk a lot about this project and complete the first part of Phase 1 in about a week, and then we stop talking about it for a week or two. I know that it\u2019s something I still have to do, but it was a new experience, so to speak. I\u2019m not sure if I prefer the way it was done but I much prefer the independent work time over regular class lectures. To put it more clearly, it wasn\u2019t a bad thing per se, it was just a new way of doing something, at least for me. Figuring out how to start the artist bio, as well as exactly what information to include, and how to organize it, has been a struggle for me personally. I\u2019m not the best at describing myself, and when I have to talk about other people, it is also hard for me. I don\u2019t know how I can get better at it other than practice, but thinking about how to start the bio or what to include first is a challenge. What can we do in Phase 2 to ensure the project is a success? I think the biggest thing for me in Phase 2 that would increase my success is a lot of input from my peers. I want to know what they are struggling with, what their bios incorporate, the type of bios they are drafting, and how much revising they did. I also want to meet with and communicate frequently with Andres to make sure the finished bio we give him is what he truly wants, and it is something that will help him personally and professionally. I think that feedback, either from you or from my peers, would be very helpful in making Jun and my artist bio the best that it can be. Feedback will be the name of the game in Phase 2, and I think that some of my peers will share the same thoughts I have, which are that we want feedback from each other, and we want to talk about how our projects are going. Finally, I think having a shorter timeline, as well as telling myself that I will do x part of the project on y day would be helpful for me to get my work done even earlier than in Phase 1.
