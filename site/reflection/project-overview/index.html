    <h1 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h1>
<p>As part of my coursework for WRIT 4662W this semester, I am working with a community partner, Serpentina Arts. Serpentina Arts is an art collective comprised of Latinx visual artists with a big presence in Minnesota. Latinx artists have banded together to form Serpentina Arts, as they are under-represented within other arts organizations. This collaboration between WRIT 4662W students and Serpentina Arts members will consist of multiple interviews to write and finalize an artist bio that each respective artist will utilize for their personal or professional career.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-for-the-interview">Preparing for the interview</h2>
<p>Before the interview, our class as a whole went over general interview questions and what to expect from our interviewee. There were certain things that Dan told us to include as part of our interview, such as asking for consent to record them, reminding them that they can skip interview questions they do not feel comfortable with answering, and ensuring that the recording has transcription enabled and will be saved to the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="conducting-recording-and-transcribing-the-interview">Conducting, recording, and transcribing the interview</h2>
<p>The interview went very smoothly, and my artist through Serpentina Arts responds very quickly to all communications and is very open about his work, both in the past and in the future. Furthermore, it was very pleasant to talk to him, it felt like a casual conversation, and the conversation flowed naturally. I learned a lot about photography, the role artists can play in the business side of companies, and what personally drives artists to keep creating original work. Transcribing the interview was a bit challenging at first, but I got the hang of it quickly. It took me around two hours to transcribe everything to a high accuracy, and I picked up on things I missed during the initial interview when I transcribed it.</p>
<h2 id="drafting-the-biography">Drafting the biography</h2>
<p>Writing the artist biography with my partner for this project was a bit hard to do at first. We had all of the necessary information from Andres, but we ultimately had to organize it in a way that he wanted both personally and professionally, as well as highlight areas of his work that deserve more attention, depending on his goals for the future. I am very grateful that my partner and I were able to peer review our biography, as there are things we both help each other with to make the best artist bio possible. The current version we have is a draft, and we are looking forward to receiving Andres' feedback and incorporating it into the final version of his artist bio.</p>
